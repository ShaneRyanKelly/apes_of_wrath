"The setting sun alights the <span class=\"direction\">Western</span> sky. The evening teems with the coming of a Seventh Moon's Night. The Night of the Seventh Moon is concentrated darkness. These brief Nights have brought with them a great hunger and a restlessness as your eyes adjust to the low light of the First Quarter, activity outside of the normal, beyond the hiding you grew used to in your youth. To your <span class=\"direction\">East</span> a great expance of Ocean opens into the great beyond. Seals play in the nearing waves as Sea Birds take to the light cross shore breeze further out.<br /><br />To the <span class=\"direction\">North</span> and <span class=\"direction\">South</span> the Beach extends underneath the full-spectrum sky. The coastline extends into the sea here, the <span class=\"direction\">Northern</span> and <span class=\"direction\">Southern</span> reaches of the Beach curve gently inwards hiding the further reaches of the coast from view. A trail leads to the <span class=\"direction\">West</span> into the soft foothills of the greater dunes.<br /><br /> At your feet are a number of dead fish, caught in the sand with the quickly receding tide."
